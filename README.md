# NalulunaFlyingScore for Beat Saber

**Once I lost all files of this project and I decompiled and rebuilt it from the dll,  
so there's a lot of incomprehensible parts in the source codes.**

This mod makes the note's cut score bounce or adds additional indicators.  
Those indicators show if you got the max score of before-cut-angle, after-cut-angle, and center-cut.  
**NOT WORK WITH "HitScoreVisualizer" mod.** You need to uninstall it if you use my mod.
